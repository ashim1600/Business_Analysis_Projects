## Project description

Understanding data visualizations and being able to communicate your ideas to others are key components of working with data. 
The goal of the project is to extract three insights from the visuals.

Give a static illustration of each insight to illustrate what you learned. Write a brief report outlining each observation and how you gathered the data for your dashboard conclusion.
